# 🧮 Python Calculator

A clean and beginner-friendly **Python Calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations using a simple command-line interface.  
This project is perfect for learning Python fundamentals, user input handling, functions, classes, and basic error management.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tara32473/python-calculator.git

	2.	Open the project folder:

cd python-calculator

	3.	Run the calculator:

python calculator.py

🧠 How It Works
	•	All math operations are handled inside a reusable Calculator class.
	•	The program shows a menu for choosing an operation.
	•	It validates user input and handles errors cleanly (like dividing by zero).
	•	It continues running until the user selects “Exit”.

📘 Code Example

calc = Calculator()
result = calc.multiply(7, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 21

💡 Future Improvements

Here are some optional upgrade ideas you can add later:
	•	GUI version using Tkinter
	•	Support for exponents, square roots, and advanced functions
	•	A calculation history
	•	Unit tests using unittest or pytest
	•	Colorized terminal output
